## WorldEditSelections: WorldEdit Add-on

WorldEditSelections is a Forge mod/Spigot plugin for WorldEdit 6 (mc12.2 and down) that enables saving and loading of all WorldEdit selections (**Except convex**)

## Commands
Permission: `worldedit.selections`
- `//selection save <selection_name>` Saves defined selection
- `//selection load <selection_name>` Loads selection and set's it

>Note: `<selection_name>` must not contain any spaces




## Selections
All WorldEdit selections (**Except convex**) are supported. Saved selections are stored in the `worldedit/selections` (`WorldEdit/selections`for the plugin) folder.

## Future commands
In a future release I plan to add the following commands:
- `//selection list (<hint>)` Will list all saved selections with the ability to filter the list
- `//selection share <selection_name>` Will enable to share a selection
